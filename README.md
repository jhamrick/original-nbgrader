# nbgrader

IPython nbconvert preprocessor for generating and grading assignments
in IPython notebooks.

Author: Jessica B. Hamrick

> This only works with a development version of IPython (09/10/2014 or
> later), as the grader functionality relies on a nbconvert
> preprocessor for executing cells, and being able to then export to
> the notebook format. Additionally, there are some bugfixes in the
> development version of IPython that affect nbgrader.

See the [documentation](docs/index.md) for instructions on
installation and usage.
