# nbgrader

IPython nbconvert preprocessor for generating and grading assignments
in IPython notebooks.

Author: Jessica B. Hamrick

> Currently (as of 09/04/2014), this only works with a development
> version of IPython, as the grader functionality relies on a
> nbconvert preprocessor for executing cells, and being able to then
> export to the notebook format.

See the [documentation](docs/index.md) for instructions on
installation and usage.
